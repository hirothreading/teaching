# A probability model for binary data: Bernoulli distribution
# If a random variable Y has a Bernoulli distribution with parameter pi(Y~Bern(pi)) then
# Y takes bianry values (i.e. 1 wp pi or 0 wp 1-pi)
# Y has a probability mass function:
# P(Y=y) = pi^y(1-pi)^(1-y), y={0,1}
# only one parameter, pi, describes the distribution:
# E[Y] = pi
# Var(Y) = pi(1-pi)
pi.true = 0.4544 #true value of pi
# this could be, for example, the outcome of a vote or referendum
